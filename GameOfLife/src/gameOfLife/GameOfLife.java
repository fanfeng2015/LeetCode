// LeetCode #289 (Game of Life).

// According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
// devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

// Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with
// its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

// Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created
// by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

	// Time complexity is O(m*n).
	// Space complexity is O(m*n).

	// Follow-up: Could you solve it in-place?
	// Answer: Use the second least bit to store the next state,
	// In the first pass, compute the next state; in the second pass, shift all
	// values to the right by one bit.
