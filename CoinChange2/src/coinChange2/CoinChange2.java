// LeetCode #518 (Coin Change 2).

// You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. 
// Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. 
// You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

public class CoinChange2 {

	// M[i]: total number of ways to make up amount i
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] M = new int[amount + 1];
        M[0] = 1;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                M[i] += M[i-coin];
            }
        }
        return M[amount];
    }
    
	// Time complexity is O(n*amount).
	// Space complexity is O(amount).
