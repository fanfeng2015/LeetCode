// LeetCode #277 (Find The Celebrity).

// Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and
// among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity
// is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

// Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one.

// The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" 
// to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one)
// by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

// You are given a helper function boolean knows(a, b), which tells you whether A knows B. 
// Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.

// There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. 
// Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

				candidate = i;
