// LeetCode #309 (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown).

// Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as
// you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following 
// restrictions:

// 1. You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the 
//    stock before you buy again).
// 2. After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day (i.e., cooldown 1 day).
