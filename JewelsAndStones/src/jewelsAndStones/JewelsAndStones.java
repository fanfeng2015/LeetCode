// LeetCode #771 (Jewels and Stones).

// You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S
// representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.

// You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
