// LeetCode #657 (Judge Route Circle)

// Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, 
// judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

// The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. 

// The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be
// true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

public class JudgeRouteCircle {

	public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
		int x = 0, y = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++) {
			if (moves.charAt(i) == 'R') {
				y += 1;
			} else if (moves.charAt(i) == 'L') {
				y -= 1;
			} else if (moves.charAt(i) == 'U') {
				x += 1;
			} else if (moves.charAt(i) == 'D') {
				x -= 1;
			}
