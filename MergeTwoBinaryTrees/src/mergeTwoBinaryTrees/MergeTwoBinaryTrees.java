// LeetCode #617 (Merge Two Binary Trees).

// Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, 
// some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

// You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes 
// overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the
// not null node will be used as the node of new tree.

public class MergeTwoBinaryTrees {

	public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
		if (t1 == null || t2 == null) {
			return t1 == null ? t2 : t1;
		}
		TreeNode newRoot = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
		newRoot.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
		newRoot.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
		return newRoot;
	}

	// Time complexity is O(m + n).
	// Space complexity is O(m + n), when the binary tree is highly unbalanced.
