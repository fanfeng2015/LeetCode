// LeetCode #213 (House Robber II).

// After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery 
// so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. 
// That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses
// remain the same as for those in the previous street.

// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount
// of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
