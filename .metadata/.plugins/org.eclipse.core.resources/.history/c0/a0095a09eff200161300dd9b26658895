// LeetCode #389

// Given two strings s and t which consist of only lower-case letters.
// String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
// Find the letter that was added in t.

		int diff = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

			diff ^= (t.charAt(i) - 'a');
		}
		diff ^= t.charAt(t.length() - 1) - 'a';
		return (char) (diff + 'a');
