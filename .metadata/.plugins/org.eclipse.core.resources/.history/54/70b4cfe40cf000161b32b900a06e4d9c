package findTheDuplicateNumber;

// LeetCode #287

// Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), 
// prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. 
// Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

// 1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
// 2 .You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
// 3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
// 4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

public class FindTheDuplicateNumber {

	// This is an interesting problem.
	// Solution 1: use HashSet: O(n) time, O(n) space.
	// Solution 2: would be sort the input array first (for primi)

}
