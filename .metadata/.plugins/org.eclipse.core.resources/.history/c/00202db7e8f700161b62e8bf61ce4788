package longestConsecutiveSequence;

// LeetCode #128

// Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
// For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
// Return its length: 4.
// Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
