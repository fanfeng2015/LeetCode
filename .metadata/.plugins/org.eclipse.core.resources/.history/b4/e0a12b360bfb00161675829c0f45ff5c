package islandPerimeter;

// LeetCode #463

// You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 
// 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally / vertically (not diagonally). 
// The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or 
// more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected
// to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, 
// width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
