// LeetCode #202

// Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
// A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
// Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by 
// the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process
// until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops
// endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
// Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

				next += Math.pow(cur % 10, 2);
				cur /= 10;
			}

				return false;
