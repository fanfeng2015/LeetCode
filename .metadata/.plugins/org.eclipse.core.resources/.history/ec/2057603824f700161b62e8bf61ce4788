package battleshipsInABoard;

// LeetCode #419

// Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. 
// The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. 
// You may assume the following rules:

// 1. You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
// 2. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
// 3. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
