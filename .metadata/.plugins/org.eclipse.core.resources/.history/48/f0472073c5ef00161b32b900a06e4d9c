package populatingNextRightPointerInEachNode;

// LeetCode #116

// Given a binary tree, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. 
// If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

// Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
// You may only use constant extra space.
// You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
