package hIndex;

// LeetCode #274

// Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
// write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her
// N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

// For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and 
// each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least
// 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

// Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

public class HIndex {

	// Solution 1: for i = n, ..., 0, count how many papers have citations
	// greater than or equal to i, return the first i --> O(n^2).
	
	// Solution 2: sort first, then for i = n, ..., 0, run binary search to find the index of the greater number smaller than i

	public int hIndex(int[] citations) {

	}
